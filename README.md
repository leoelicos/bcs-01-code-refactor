## Description

Any advertising agency needs good SEO to be found by potential clients searching for an advertising agency online.

I refactored this code to illustrate the importance of accessibility standards, because a codebase with bad accessibility standards is hard to maintain and also ranks lower in SEO.

While refactoring the code, I learned about the importance of semantic HTML elements and keeping them separate from styling. I also learned the importance of attributes for icons and images to help people with disabilities access the app.
