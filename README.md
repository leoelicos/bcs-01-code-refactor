# Code Refactor

## Description

Any advertising agency needs good SEO to be found by potential clients searching for an advertising agency online.

I built this website to illustrate the importance of accessibility standards, because a codebase with bad accessibility standards is hard to maintain and also ranks lower in SEO.

While building this project, I learned about the importance of semantic HTML elements and keeping them separate from styling. I also learned to add attributes to icons and images to help people with disabilities.
